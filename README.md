# Integer Circle Explorer
[Live version](https://grego.site/integer_circle)

Audiovisual explorer of the integer circle algorithm utilizing GPU rendering.
Made using the [sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) headers.

Inspired by [Fractal Sound Explorer](https://github.com/HackerPoet/FractalSoundExplorer).

## The algorithm
Given the parameters `delta` and `epsilon` and an initial point `x, y`, we iteratively
update its coordinates by
```
x -= floor(delta * y)
y += floor(epsilon * x)
x -= floor(delta * y)
```
A three step rather than the more well-known two step algorithm is used,
as the patterns generated by the latter display a distractive 45 degree tilt.

The points are colored based on the length of their orbits and the coordinates
are fed to left and right audio channels.

## Building
```
make
```
It should be possible to build this project for every platform sokol supports, however,
only Linux and WebAssembly have been tried so far. To build WebAssembly, run
```
make integer_circle.js
```
Building the WebAssembly requires [emscripten](https://emscripten.org). Suggestions to adapt
the project for simpler tooling are welcome.
